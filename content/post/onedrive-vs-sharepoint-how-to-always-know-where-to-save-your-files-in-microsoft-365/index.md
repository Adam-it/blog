# OneDrive vs SharePoint: How to Always Know Where to Save Your Files in Microsoft 365
One of the most persistent frustrations for anyone moving into the Microsoft 365 ecosystem isn't the software itself, but the simple, nagging question of where a file actually belongs. You click 'Save' and are immediately met with two choices: OneDrive and SharePoint. On the surface, they look identical. Both sync to your computer, both allow for version history, and both live in the cloud. However, treating them as interchangeable is exactly how files get lost, links break, and teams lose hours of productivity.

To understand the difference, you have to stop thinking about the technology and start thinking about the **ownership** of the work.

##  OneDrive — The Personal Space
OneDrive is designed as your digital briefcase. It is intrinsically tied to your individual identity within the company. By default, everything you put there is invisible to everyone else. This makes it the ideal environment for the "messy" stage of work. When you are drafting a proposal, sketching out a budget, or taking raw notes during a meeting, you don't necessarily want your manager or your peers seeing the half-finished thoughts or the formatting errors.

The most important thing to remember about OneDrive, however, is its shelf life. Because the account is tied to you personally, those files are at risk if you ever change roles or leave the organisation. If you keep a critical project tracker in your OneDrive and then move to a different department, your old team is left with a "broken link" crisis. OneDrive is for "Me" work—the tasks that belong to your specific daily workflow and don't yet require the collective eyes of the group.

## Transitioning to the Team Space
SharePoint is the corporate filing cabinet. Unlike OneDrive, files here belong to the project or the department, not the person who created them. This is where work goes to live permanently. If you are part of a marketing team, the finalized campaign assets, the shared calendars, and the brand guidelines should never touch a personal OneDrive. They need to be in SharePoint so that if any one person is out of the office, the business can continue to function without a hitch.

The real magic happens when you stop seeing these as "either/or" choices and start seeing them as a lifecycle. A healthy habit is to start every new document in your OneDrive. This gives you the privacy to fail, edit, and refine in peace. Once that document reaches a point where someone else needs to provide feedback or use the data, you should move it—not copy it—into the relevant SharePoint site. This ensures there is only ever one "source of truth," preventing that classic corporate headache where three different people are editing three different versions of the same spreadsheet.


### Conclusion: The “Me vs We” Rule
When you're hovering over that save button, ask yourself a single pragmatic question: "If I were unavailable tomorrow, would my team be stuck because they couldn't access this?" If the answer is **yes**, it belongs in **SharePoint**. If the file is just for your eyes or contains personal admin like performance reviews or expense drafts, keep it in **OneDrive**.

By following this **"Me vs. We"** logic, you aren't just organizing your folders; you’re ensuring that the company’s collective knowledge stays where it belongs—accessible, secure, and permanent.
