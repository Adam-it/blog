## Nico De Cleyre in his own words

My career began in an unexpected way, during a holiday job repairing lotto machines across Belgium. A simple question changed everything: Were they still looking for employees in their consultancy department? When they asked if I knew SharePoint, I had no answer. But with a quick Google search, I was determined to find out. That curiosity led me to start as a SharePoint developer, where I did dangerous things in the GAC üòú. Fast forward many years, and today, I am a Microsoft 365 architect at ConXioN. What defines me is the constant pursuit of knowledge - investing, searching, discovering new technologies. This  curiosity has shaped me into an all-rounder with deep expertise across the M365 ecosystem.

The Microsoft PnP community was never unfamiliar to me. Yet, for a long time, I stood on the sidelines, held back by the imposter syndrome. But a few years back I chose to take the step and started contributing actively to PnP Open-source projects. I quickly realized that my contributions didn't just benefit the community, I gained knowledge, new perspectives and a deeper connection with the Microsoft 365 ecosystem in return.

Outside of work I am a proud married father of 2 daughters and cherish every moment I can spend with my family. I enjoy gardening and caring for & loving our animals. With 4 dogs, 2 cats, 4 chickens, 2 rabbits and a water turtle you could say I am somewhat of an animal lover ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.

## Saurabh Tripathi in his own words

I am a M365 Developer and currently working as a Solutions Architect at AFRY. I have done all kinds of work with SharePoint but have always been a Developer at heart since the beginning. A lot of my work has been on SharePoint on-prem, and I used to proudly say, "It is purely for storage, but you would never know if it's SharePoint just by looking at it." 
With M365, I had been quietly taking inspiration from the PnP community in my day to day work, until one day I heard someone cool say, "Why not contribute to the tools you use every day?" That really resonated with me, and since then, I look for opportunities to contribute whenever I can.

Outside of work, I am a stay-at-home, spend-time-with-family kind of guy. Also, I love a good workout and can't go long without one.
