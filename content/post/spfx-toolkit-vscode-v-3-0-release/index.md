## 🗒️ Quick intro

[SharePoint Framework Toolkit](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=m365pnp.viva-connections-toolkit) is a Visual Studio Code extension that aims to boost your productivity in developing and managing [SharePoint Framework solutions](https://learn.microsoft.com/sharepoint/dev/spfx/sharepoint-framework-overview?WT.mc_id=m365-15744-cxa) helping at every stage of your development flow, from setting up your development workspace to deploying a solution straight to your tenant without the need to leave VS Code, it even allows you to create a CI/CD pipeline to introduce automate deployment of your app 🚀.

All of that is possible due to the awesome work done by the [PnP community](https://pnp.github.io/) which is visible in many functionalities of this extension: sample gallery filled with [PnP samples](https://pnp.github.io/#samples), upgrading SPFx project using [CLI for Microsoft 365](https://pnp.github.io/cli-microsoft365/), and many more. 

It does not matter if you are starting your journey with SPFx development and Viva solutions or if you are already experienced in this area, this VS Code extension will have the features you need to kick off your work to the next level 💪.

We are pleased to announce that we finally finished working on the v3 version which includes a number of awesome game-changer features that makes building and managind SharePoint Framework solutions a lot easier.

Among many things that was done those are the updates that stand out most 👇:

## 🗺️ Future roadmap

We don't plan to stop, we are already thinking of v4 and new ways to extend features that were introduced in this release. If you want to check what we are planning or add your own idea please [join the discussion](https://github.com/pnp/vscode-viva/discussions/159). Feedback is appreciated 👍.

## 👍 Power of the community

This extension would not have been possible if it weren’t for the awesome work done by the [Microsoft 365 & Power Platform Community](https://pnp.github.io/). Each sample gallery: SPFx web parts & extensions, and ACE samples & scenarios are all populated with the contributions done by the community. Many of the functionalities of the extension like upgrading, validating, and deploying your SPFx project, would not have been possible if it wasn’t for the [CLI for Microsoft 365](https://pnp.github.io/cli-microsoft365/) tool. I would like to sincerely thank all of our awesome contributors! Creating this extension would not have been possible if it weren’t for the enormous work done by the community. You all rock 🤩.
